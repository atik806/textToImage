AI Image Generator using FLUX.1 Model
This Python script allows users to generate images from text descriptions using the FLUX.1 model from Hugging Face's model hub.

Features
Text-to-image generation using FLUX.1 model
Interactive command-line interface
Direct image display capability
Error handling for invalid responses
Prerequisites
You need to have the following Python packages installed:

bash


pip install requests
pip install Pillow
Setup
Clone this repository or copy the script
Make sure you have a valid Hugging Face API token
Replace the token in the headers variable with your own token:
python


headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"}
Usage
Run the script:
bash


python image_generator.py
Enter a text description when prompted
The generated image will automatically open in your default image viewer
How it Works
The script sends a POST request to the FLUX.1 model API with your text description
The API returns the generated image as bytes
The image is converted and displayed using PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling for:

Invalid API responses
Image processing errors
Network-related issues
API Reference
The script uses the FLUX.1 model API endpoint:

https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev
Dependencies
requests: For making HTTP requests to the API
PIL (Python Imaging Library): For image processing and display
io: For handling byte streams
